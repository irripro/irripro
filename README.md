Graduated from the Department of Water Conservancy at Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College in July 1984, currently specializing in irrigation and drainage engineering at China Agricultural University. A seasoned smart irrigation expert with over 40 years of experience in the industry,  I made the well-known "Master of Irrigation" website. I has served as a senior engineer at Guangxi Agricultural Reclamation Design Institute and as general manager of the Irrigation Division at Luyou Group. I was also the former COO of Shanghai Shengrui Software Technology Co., Ltd. and technical director of Huaweijieshui Irrigation Group Co. Ltd. I previously worked as a data analyst for listed company Jinglan Technology.

With over forty years dedicated to the efficient irrigation industry, I have been responsible for managing well-known irrigation websites as "Irrigation Master" and the WeChat public account "Irrigation Knowledge" as well as serving as a part-time administrator for "Irrigation Website." I have held positions such as the Director of the Computer Dep. at Guangxi Agricultural Reclamation Design Institute, General Manager of the Irrigation Division at Luyou Group, and Technical Director at Huawei Water-saving Irrigation Group Company, where I also planned and architected the Internet of Things application (Agriculture Head-up). Additionally, I have served as a Data Analyst at Jinglan Yun Technology Company and am currently the Strategic Advisor at Wuhan Heda Company.

In November 1989, I published a paper in the Proceedings of the 4th International Micro-Irrigation Conference in Australia, titled "THE METHOD OF AUTOMATIC SUITABLE SIMULATION FOR SPRAY SYSTEM, Proc. Vol.1, (2B-2), Albury." This paper was awarded the Second Prize for Excellent Paper by the Spray Irrigation Technology Information Network. In 1995, upon invitation by the South Australian Department of Agriculture and approval by the Guangxi Education Department, I visited the ICMS Research Institute in South Australia as a visiting scholar. With over four decades of theoretical and practical experience, I am well-versed in modern irrigation theory, intelligent irrigation control, and IoT technology. I have published numerous professional papers in "Water-saving Irrigation," with many receiving major awards within the domestic irrigation industry.

During my tenure at Wuhan University Yunshiu Company, I participated in the design and construction of the irrigation system and garden water system projects at the South China Botanical Garden in Guangzhou, as well as the installation of the underground drip irrigation system project for the Israel Meiz Company at Jianguomen. I have developed computer software applications for pipeline networks. In recent years, I have mainly engaged in the research and development of the application of crop mathematical models, providing crop model application consulting for intelligent irrigation decision-making to several companies. I have participated in the formulation of national standards for agricultural digital technicians, making outstanding contributions to the creation of digital irrigation using IoT in the field of agricultural planting.
